# Organizer App

This app is a personal project I have been mading just to help me organice myself. It usefull when you have a lot of things to do and you want not to forget anything. 

In this version of the app you can make some groups, for example:

    - Supermarket: where you put some stuff you have to buy there
    - Work: where you make a list of to do 
    - Vacationes: you can make a list of things that you have to bring with you

In the near future you also will be able to make a group and invite people to participate there but that part is in process right now.
